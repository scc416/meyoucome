            There’s nothing quite worse than being stuck and feeling bored in
            one of those online meetings. You’ve definitely been in at least one
            of the following situations:
          </div>
          <div>
            <div><img src="public/features1.png" /></div>
            <div>
              Being stuck in a never-ending work video conference/meeting.
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src="public/features2.png" />
            </div>
            <div>
              Trying to stay/look awake during a dull online lecture/lesson.
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src="public/features3.png" />
            </div>
            <div>
              Having to explain video calls to a family member/relative who
              doesn’t quite understand how it works, keeps asking you billions
              of questions, and shouts “Can you hear me? Hello, HELLO?” because
              they think you won’t be able to hear them otherwise.
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src="public/features4.png" />
            </div>
            <div>
              You agreed to participate in an air nomikai (online drinking
              party), only to find that your friend/colleague has had a little
              too much to drink and won’t stop going on about their ex. (Move on
              already!)
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            In these scenarios, all you wish for is a magic escape button to
            quickly get you out of the video call before you completely lose it.
            Well, you won’t have to think “If only…” for much longer!
          </div>
          <div>
            You will now be able to exit those dreaded video chats with the
            Loading Circle Online Meeting Emergency Escape Machine. This
            excellent little invention designed by Marina Fujiwara fakes a
            frozen screen so you can leave without hurting, embarrassing, or
            offending the other person/people in the video chat.

            From the brain of Japanese inventor
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mudazukuri/" target="_blank"
              >Marina Fujiwara</a
            >, the escape machine is a real life prop that looks identical to
            the loading circle that appears in the middle of a person’s screen
            when their video chat freezes. Place it in front of your computer
            screen, flip a switch on the machine’s base and the loading circle
            will pop out, giving others online the impression your computer has
            frozen.
          </div>
          <div><img src="public/marina-fujiwara.jpeg" /></div>
        </div>
        <div>
          Of course, the product will only work if you pretend to be frozen too,
          meaning its success requires a bit of acting on the user’s part.
